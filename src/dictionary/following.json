This partly autobiographical novel tells us about a writer who came to a private school for unusually developed children. Their isolation is supported by a legend of an incurable illness that their teachers suffer. The teachers are locally called \\u201Cmokretsy\\u201D (The wet ones; also unpleasant insects), which in Russian sounds similar to \\u201Cmudresty\\u201D, the wise ones. In the end of the novel the children leave their parents and society. It is considered that in \\u201CThe Ugly Swans\\u201D Strugatsky brothers give their version of the communist utopia which is only possible through the break-up with the old world where the iniquity passes from generation to generation. And only the world of the unusually developed children, in which even there wise teachers cannot enter in the end, is able to grow to the humanity's bright future.Quite soon this blog turned into an independent narrative which actually serves as a reference book for my personal art projects. There are visual materials on Soviet space program, museums of cosmonautics, architecture and the art of Soviet modernism from 60ies to 80ies, the philosophy of Russian cosmism and the left accelerationism. The majority of the photos are found on the internet, others are made by me, some are parts of my personal art projects.

Krysten's public appearances, like premieres and parties, can be found under the &quot;event&quot; tag. You can even search by costar if you wanted. :) \\n\\nIf tumblr is being a jerk and you're not able to find anything with the search bar, then try to find an image with the same tag you're searching for. That seems to provide better results.\"","url":"http://fuckyeahkrystenritter.tumblr.com/","updated":1448162796},{"name":"krystenritterlove","title":"\"Krysten Ritter\"","description":"\"This is dedicated to the lovely Krysten Ritter in here you can ask  and be provided with all your Krysten pictures!\"","url":"http://krystenritterlove.tumblr.com/","updated":1466551937},{"name":"proletarian","title":"\"thoroughly undialectical\"","description":"\"                                                                                                    social justice warrior, proletarian feminist, marxist-leninist-maoist, anti-imperialist, heideggerian, trans queer psychedelicist\"","url":"http://proletarian.tumblr.com/","updated":1463216057},{"name":"foxwithsocks","title":"\"airplanes and boatshoes\"","description":"\"\"","url":"http://foxwithsocks.tumblr.com/","updated":1470871781},{"name":"nemfrog","title":"\"nemfrog\"","description":"\"1910's Blogger of the Year\"","url":"http://nemfrog.tumblr.com/","updated":1470891693},{"name":"fuckyeahnonphilosophy","title":"\"FYNP\"","description":"\"Fuck Yeah, Non-Philosophy!\"","url":"http://fuckyeahnonphilosophy.tumblr.com/","updated":1383505309},{"name":"thebodhisattvatrader","title":"\"THE BODHISATTVA TRADER\"","description":"\"daily trading meditations\"","url":"http://thebodhisattvatrader.tumblr.com/","updated":1433509257},{"name":"voidgirls666","title":"\"fuck\"","description":"\"lily | 17 | agender trans girl | anarchist | they/them | gay as hell\"","url":"http://voidgirls666.tumblr.com/","updated":1470887166},{"name":"crimeislord","title":"\"CRIME IS LORD\"","description":"\"\\nWe are a movement, a religious order, a sect, a political body, a terrorist group, a magazine, a lifestyle, a blog, a national security threat, a global presence, a network, an ideology.

An exhibition space rather than a collecting institution, MoMA PS1 devotes its energy and resources to displaying the most experimental art in the world. A catalyst and an advocate for new ideas, discourses, and trends in contemporary art, MoMA PS1 actively pursues emerging artists, new genres, and adventurous new work by recognized artists in an effort to support innovation in contemporary art. MoMA PS1 achieves this mission by presenting its diverse program to a broad audience in a unique and welcoming environment in which visitors can discover and explore the work of contemporary artists. Exhibitions at MoMA PS1 include artists' retrospectives, site-specific installations, historical surveys, arts from across the United States and the world, and a full schedule of music and performance programming. \\n\\nMoMA PS1 was founded in 1971 by Alanna Heiss as the Institute for Art and Urban Resources Inc., an organization devoted to organizing exhibitions in underutilized and abandoned spaces across New York City. In 1976, it opened the first major exhibition in its permanent location in Long Island City, Queens, with the seminal Rooms exhibition. An invitation for artists to transform the building's unique spaces, Rooms established the MoMA PS1 tradition of transforming the building's spaces into site-specific art that continues today with long-term installations by James Turrell, Richard Serra, Lawrence Weiner, and others. \\n\\nFor the next twenty years, the building was used as studio, performance, and exhibition spaces, in support of artists from around the world. After a building-wide renovation, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center (now MoMA PS1) reopened in 1997, confirming its position as the leading contemporary art center in New York. True to the building's history and form, the renovation preserved much of the original architecture as well as most of its unique classroom-sized galleries. \\n\\nIn 2000, P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center became an affiliate of The Museum of Modern Art to extend the reach of both institutions, and combine MoMA PS1's contemporary mission with MoMA's strength as one of the greatest collecting museums of modern art. 2010 marks the completed merger of the two institutions and celebrates P.S.1's new and exciting chapter as MoMA PS1.\\n\\nA true artistic laboratory, MoMA PS1 aspires to maintain its diverse and innovative activities to continue to bring contemporary art to international audiences.\"","url":"http://momaps1.tumblr.com/","updated":1464056133},{"name":"judgmentalmaps","title":"\"JUDGMENTAL MAPS\"","description":"\"Your city.

How come symbols behave like materials (\\u201Cfake\\u201D and \\u201Creal\\u201D brands)? Why have commodities become the historical subject (do we furnish our world with IKEA or rather we dwell in its world)? Are humans reduced to simply absorbing surpluses (with baby diapers being a form of child labor)? How labor has shifted from production to consumption? Why is everything we do is work (even when we are not employed) and how can a generation overqualified for the labor market can change everything?\\n\\n\\nThis blog hosts source materials and documents, together with commentary and analysis. \\n\\nRe-introducing different notions of dialectical materialism into the already established conversation on the subjectivity of things, Neomaterialism challenges the investigation which the new-materialists have begun, relating it to labor, debt, credit, animisim and alienation, life-taxes and social organization. \\n\\n\\nWith the book Neomaterialism (Sternberg Press, 2013), available in stores now the blog also operates as an ongoing archive for references, reviews and events. \"","url":"http://neomaterialism.tumblr.com/","updated":1424985918},{"name":"blogging-about-the-east","title":"\"DDR,Soviet and east block romanticising\"","description":"\"A history blog about the East block with the USSR and GDR.\"","url":"http://blogging-about-the-east.tumblr.com/","updated":1402055539},{"name":"baeddelaire","title":"\"space\\u26A1butch\\u26A1pink clover\"","description":"\"but before I am free, I see the asteroid belt; and my spaceship shatters into a thousand perfect shards, and I am lost forever in the endless leavings of this old, grand galaxy\"","url":"http://baeddelaire.tumblr.com/","updated":1440794882},{"name":"vayena","title":"\"hot young coward\"","description":"\"???????????????\"","url":"http://vayena.tumblr.com/","updated":1470835759},{"name":"golfwang","title":"\"GOLF WANG\"","description":"\"\"","url":"http://golfwang.tumblr.com/","updated":1470344230},{"name":"watchingcbeams","title":"\"\"","description":"\"\"","url":"http://watchingcbeams.tumblr.com/","updated":1470680879},{"name":"bearnigga-blog","title":"\"Bear Nigga's Page\"","description":"\"I am a bear. \"","url":"http://bearnigga-blog.tumblr.com/","updated":1316819295},{"name":"llo-ro-na","title":"\"llorona\"","description":"\"\"","url":"http://ana-cecilia-alvarez.com/","updated":1470633745},{"name":"bapesquad","title":"\"Bathing Apes\"","description":"\"                                                                \\nPortland OR.\"","url":"http://bapesquad.tumblr.com/","updated":1470688336},{"name":"notalkingplz","title":"\"HIGHLIGHTER AND SHARPIE PARTY\"","description":"\" \\n\"","url":"http://notalkingplz.tumblr.com/","updated":1470882326},{"name":"samanthawright-blog","title":"\"Put it in your head, baby Hollywood is dead\"","description":"\"Samantha, sammy, sam. \"","url":"http://samanthawright-blog.tumblr.com/","updated":1347353857},{"name":"rosemarys---distant---relative","title":"\"\"","description":"\"                                                                \"","url":"http://rosemarys---distant---relative.tumblr.com/","updated":1470519698},{"name":"bighairybruisedhill","title":"\"BHBH/////////////big.hairy.bruised.hill\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"","description":"\"Follow and like BHBH/////////////big.hairy.bruised.hill\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ on facebook :\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/bighairybruisedhill\\n\\nBHBH/////////////bighairybruisedhill\\nis an online mood board which is updated frequently based on a hidden theme\\n\\nThis is a collection of images that covers a wide array of topics which includes art, design, fashion, science, plants, food, photography and many many many more!\\n\\nBHBH tries to capture visuals that circulates around us to form a palette of stories of what we have become.\\n\\nBHBH does not own the rights to the images published.
